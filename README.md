# Mod the Dungeon (without anitpiracy measure)
It's just a fork of Mod The Dungeon but this will let you play with a pirate copy.
Have the game on other platform and don't want to buy it on PC just to mod it? (like me lol) This is the solution.

Compiling instructions will be avaible soon


Why did I do this? I bought the game on PS4 and I won't pay for it again just to mod it on PC.
